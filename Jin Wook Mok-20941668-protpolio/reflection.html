                    <h2>Learning Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        As part of my university coursework, I am studying Business Web and Mobile Technologies. I am mainly learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have finished 6 projects: two WebDesign, RPS, FlatLand, ToDo, and RSS Reader. Through the projects, I understood how HTML, CSS, and Javascript interact with each other. The fact that I can visually see the results of my work in real-time, unlike other programming languages such as Java, has been a driving force behind my passionate studying.

                    <h2>Challenges and Improvement</h2>
                    <p>
                        With my current programming knowledge, I faced many difficulties in creating the portfolio website that I had planned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, I had an issue setting up icons for the navigation of the portfolio website and social media profile. With my existing knowledge, I had to search for individual images for icons and create code for each of them. However, I used the Font Awesome site. This site is the Internet's icon library. Using this website, I was able to easily add the desired icons to my portfolio in a simple way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, I did not know many terminologies for programming. For example, I only used the px unit, but when I looked at the code to refer to several websites, I saw a lot of the rem units as well. I tried to use many elements and units while creating my portfolio website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third, I was unaware of the @media function, but while analysing several websites for my portfolio site, I learned that the @media function is used for responsive design, so I applied it to my portfolio site. The @media function enables the website's appearance or layout to be altered depending on the size of the device being used. If I had to mention one thing that I applied, it was the left sidebar moving upwards (I applied top: 0;) depending on the device's size, which I was able to confirm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last, I couldn't think of many events to use JavaScript in my portfolio. Most of the JavaScript events that I know of required a click to be activated. There were not many situations where a click was necessary on my portfolio site. So, I tried creating a visual effect when the mouse cursor hovered over particular boxes. The first event changes the CSS properties of the hovered element to create a visual effect and the second event resets the properties of the element to their original values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While creating the portfolio, I felt frustrated in many parts and it took a lot of time to understand and apply them. However, as I solved each problem one by one and saw the changes visually in the portfolio website, I was able to feel a sense of accomplishment.
